Description: Extends the Seurat classes and functions to support Genomic Data
        Structure (GDS) files as a DelayedArray backend for data representation.
        It relies on the implementation of GDS-based DelayedMatrix in the
        SCArray package to represent single cell RNA-seq data. The common
        optimized algorithms leveraging GDS-based and single cell-specific
        DelayedMatrix (SC_GDSMatrix) are implemented in the SCArray package.
        SCArray.sat introduces a new SCArrayAssay class (derived from the
        Seurat Assay), which wraps raw counts, normalized expressions and
        scaled data matrix based on GDS-specific DelayedMatrix. It is designed
        to integrate seamlessly with the Seurat package to provide common data
        analysis in the SeuratObject-based workflow. Compared with Seurat,
        SCArray.sat significantly reduces the memory usage without downsampling
        and can be applied to very large datasets.
